# Semester 2: Fundamentals of Data Analysis
## Investigate Ascombe's Quartet

In this repository you will find my investigation of Ascombe's quartet. 

My investigation is in the file "anscombe.ipynb". 

### To open an ipynb file on your machine
* Download "anscombe.ipynb" to your computer.
* Open a terminal, such as Command Prompt, and first, check if Jupyter is installed on your machine. Type the command, 'jupyter -- version' to determine this, and also to see which version is installed on your machine. You should also ensure Python is on your machine, by entering the command 'python --version'.

* If Jupyter Notebook is **not** installed, you should download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which supports Jupyter files, and Python code. 
* Once Jupyter is installed, type the command, 'jupyter notebook' to open a webpage displaying the folder you're currently in. You may need to copy and paste the URL (highlighted below) that appears on the command line, if a webpage doesn't automatically open.

**NOTE:** When opening Jupyter notebook, ensure your downloaded ipynb file is in a subdirectory of the folder you are in.
* From the webpage, navigate to the folder containing your ipynb file and click to open in a new tab.
