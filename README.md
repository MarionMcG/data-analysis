# Semester 2: Fundamentals of Data Analysis
## Investiagte Ascombe's Quartet

In this repository you will find my investigation og Ascombe's quartet. 

My investigation is in the file "anscombe.ipynb". 

### To open an ipynb file on your machine
* Download "anscombe.ipynb" to your computer
* Open a terminal, such as Command Prompt, and first, check if Jupyter is installed on your machine. Type the command, 'jupyter notebook -- version' to determine this, and also to see which version is installed on your machine. 
* If Jupyter Notebook is **not** installed, you should download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which supports Jupyter files, and Python code. 
* Once Jupyter is installed, type the command, 'jupyter notebook' to open a webpage displaying the folder you're currently in. You may need to copy and paste the URL that appears on the command line, if a webpage doesn't automatically open. **NOTE:** When opening Jupyter notebook, ensure your downloaded ipynb file is in a subdirectory of the folder you are in.
* From the webpage, navigate to the folder containing your ipynb file and click to open in a new tab.
